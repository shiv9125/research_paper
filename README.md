****fault tolerance in cloud****
Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system (computer, network, cloud cluster, etc.) to continue operating without interruption when one or more of its components fail.

The objective of creating a fault-tolerant system is to prevent disruptions arising from a single point of failure, ensuring the high availability and business continuity of mission-critical applications or systems.
Fault tolerance can play a role in a disaster recovery strategy. For example, fault-tolerant systems with backup components in the cloud can restore mission-critical systems quickly, even if a natural or human-induced disaster destroys on-premise IT infrastructure.
